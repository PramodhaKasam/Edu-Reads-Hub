## EduReadsHub

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it serves as a comprehensive resource for students who aspire to gain admission to prestigious engineering institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs). The website is designed with several key features to assist students in their preparation and decision-making process.

### Features:

1. **Reference Book Repository:**
   - The website offers a dedicated section where students can access and download reference books for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. These books are specifically chosen for their relevance and are the same ones used by top rankers to prepare for competitive exams like the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). This feature ensures that students have access to the best possible study materials.

2. **Rank and College Selection Insights:**
   - Another significant feature of the website is a tool that allows users to input their expected or actual JEE rank. Based on this input, the tool provides historical data showing the ranks of students who previously secured admission to various branches at top IITs and NITs. It also includes insights into why these students chose their respective colleges and branches, offering valuable guidance to current aspirants as they make their own decisions.

3. **Senior Feedback Section:**
   - The website includes a section where current and former students (seniors) share their experiences and feedback. This could include their thoughts on the college they attended, the branch they chose, and how well their college experience aligned with their expectations. This feedback can be invaluable for new students who are in the process of making critical decisions about their education and career paths.

4. **Alumni Contributions:**
   - The alumni section is designed to engage graduates from IITs and NITs by allowing them to submit their own ranks, share their success stories, and offer advice to current aspirants. Alumni can provide insights into their career trajectories, the impact of their education on their professional lives, and tips for succeeding both during college and beyond.

### Purpose:
The overall goal of the website is to create a supportive community and a centralized resource hub for students aiming for top engineering colleges in India. By offering access to top-tier study materials, providing data-driven insights into college selection, and fostering a network of senior and alumni feedback, the website aims to guide students at every step of their journey toward achieving their dreams of securing a seat at an IIT or NIT.
